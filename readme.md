# Misophonia and Airway/Myofunction Survey (August 2025)

This is the code for an online survey I am conducting to investigate the relationship between misophonia and craniofacial dystrophy (CFD), which is related to airway and myofunctional health.

Survey: [Misophonia and Airway/Myofunction](https://miso-airway-survey.vercel.app/).

## Gus Hogg-Blake

I am an independent researcher and patient advocate for misophonia and CFD.

In 2011 I started being triggered by the shape of my own mouth, which ultimately led me to airway-focused orthodontics and then, when the Motor Basis paper came out, to the idea that there could be a deeper connection between the two conditions.
