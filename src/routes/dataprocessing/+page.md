# Data Processing Policy

## Data Processed

- When a respondent submits the survey form, the app sends the respondent's answers to the server.

- Due to the nature of the web, all requests include some personally identifying information such as IP addresses. The app does not store or otherwise use this information.

- The app does not use cookies, local storage, user-agent-based fingerprinting, or any other method of tracking individuals or browser sessions.

## Receipt and Storage of Submissions

- Submissions are stored in a database in New York, US.

- When a submission is received, a unique, random, and cryptographically secure identifier is generated. The identifier is stored with the submission and included in the submission response page.

- If a respondent saves the identifier, they can use it to delete or update their submission. The identifier cannot be used to view the submitted answers.

## Right to Withdraw

- A respondent may withdraw from the survey, provided they have the identifier. To withdraw, send an email to [gus@gushogg-blake.com](mailto:gus@gushogg-blake.com) including the word "withdraw", "delete", or similar, and your submission identifier.

## Processing Withdrawal and Update Correspondence

- Communications (e.g. emails) containing submission identifiers will only be kept for as long as necessary to complete the requested action.

## Publication

- The data collected in the survey may be published in either raw or aggregated form at any time.

- In any case, the raw data will be published no later than 30 days after the closing date of the survey.

- The submission identifiers will not be published.
